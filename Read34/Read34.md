## Android Monetization
**Choose a monetization model for your app**
  * To maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets. Different audiences can have different preferences for paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and other ecommerce.
  * Sell goods or services through your app
    - Two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.
    - Google Play's billing system - use it to sell digital goods or services within an app on Google Play, and makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app.  
    - Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. 
    - Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include: virtual game products, app functionality or content, subscription services, and Cloud software products.
  * Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay
    - Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app. Provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online. Speeds up your checkout process, as users won't need to enter their payment details each time or when they first download your app.
